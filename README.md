# Kaizen App

## Description

As a User, I want a web page that allows me to enter in a list of my goals and when I want them done by. After I post these, I can see them on my profile, and see a homepage of other people's goals. When I click on their goals, I want to be able to leave a comment of encouragement to cheer them on. When I am finished with a goal, I want to be able to update it to log my completion.

## Usage

To use this app, visit the page here; [LINK](https://kaizen-app-41aa736296bb.herokuapp.com/). Create an account, then post your goals and when you'd like them completed. After this, you can peruse the posts of other users, and interact as you like. When you have worked on your goal, completed it, or would like to change it in any way you can edit your post - or delete it! Have you said something on a comment cheering someone on, and realized there was an error? Edit your comment, or delete that too and leave a newer one! 

## Future

In the future, we would like to expand on this application to allow for more detailed goal planning, improved appearance, and options to follow or add friends to keep track of other users and cheer on friends more efficiently. We would also like to add a moderation strategy to keep any negativity at bay to provide a healthy and happy social media presence, with plenty of encouragement for growth!

## Test

If you would like to test this, simply create an account and make your post!
