# Kaizen App

## Description

As a User, I want a web page that allows me to enter in a list of my goals and when I want them done by. After I post these, I can see them on my profile, and see a homepage of other people's goals. When I click on their goals, I want to be able to leave a comment of encouragement to cheer them on. When I am finished with a goal, I want to be able to update it to log my completion.
